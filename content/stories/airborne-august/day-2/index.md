A wolf — blue and green hair, light fur, and black paws — was out exploring an abandoned building. The building’s walls were heavily cracked and rusted and the interior was covered in dust, rubble, vegetation, and the occasional vandal’s tag. However, for a building this overrun, it somehow still had powered technology. The sounds of machinery still churning away at whatever its job was and a dying loudspeaker in the distance sputtering off its last few tones before going silent filled the halls.

The wolf used a miniature flashlight to read a sign on a door. The sign read “WARNING! Only staff beyond this point. Violators will be punished.” Looking around and determining there was no one there to punish this curious wolf, they opened the door. Behind it sat a long, narrow corridor lined with large tile floor and brick walls. Whatever it was, it definitely wasn’t made to look pretty.

They entered the hallway, and almost immediately the door closed behind them with a creak from the hinge and a tch-kit from the latch. They tried opening the door again, but the door’s handle seemed to be jammed. Whatever this was, there was no turning back now.
They continued down the large hallway, a chill coming down their spine as the cold air got to them. The hall felt like it was never-ending, twisting and turning all over. Eventually, an end came in sight as the hall ahead seemed to turn into a large common room leading into some offices.

However, before reaching the room, they feel the floor dip down a bit. No worries, they’ll just continue down the hall and- oomph! They felt something trip them up. They looked back at their foot and noticed that a bubble stuck itself to it, quickly wrapping itself around and forming round bubble boots.

As soon as they landed, even more bubbles came to attack them. A bubble went and blooped their other foot much quicker since it was stationary. Same with their spread out hands, both ensnared in their own bubbly gloves as quickly as everything else. They tried getting back up again, but the slippery surfaces on all of their appendages just caused them to fall to the floor once more. They tried taking the restraints off, but their useless bubble bappers didn’t serve much help, just causing the bubbles to squeak against one another.

But before giving them any more time to react, the floor beneath them fell, the tile revealing itself to be a trapdoor. They were caught by a bubble film held out by four mechanical arms and a wireframe in a square form. The falling wolf caused the film to indent in, causing a swift and sudden bubbling.

A magical aura seemed to glow around the wolf, locking them in the air. This made it easier for the mechanical hands, now entering the bubble, to manipulate and secure their new prisoner. The trapped wolf, trying to get at least some part of themself out of the bubble, pushed up with their bubbled paws and to the side with their tail, but the bubble would only stretch, denying their every attempt at escape.

Just then, two arms grabbed onto their hand bubbles and another to their feet. They started pushing each together, merging them until they became two tight bubble cuffs, stretchy yet restraining. The wolf fiddled around with the new cuffs, stretching them out in an attempt to break them. However, the bubbles were just too strong, showing no signs of weakening from their stretching.

Continuing their escape attempt, they began kicking both their feet, wiggling about, pushing the arms away with their bubble-cuffed paws, and screaming and shouting. Just then, they heard a loudspeaker come on. “Unruly prisoner detected. Initiating restraining protocol,” it had blared to them and only them. Just then, they felt their maw squished against by a bubble, an arm pressing it against them before it blooped around it. Still connected to the bubble, the arm started pulling the air back in, vacuum-sealing their maw shut. They tried opening it, but their jaw just wouldn’t move. They began breathing heavily, blushing out of embarrassment and scared by what the robots would do next.

They heard the sound of hissing coming from behind and in front of them, two arms pushing bubbles against the wolf’s neck. Quickly growing, wrapping, connecting, and merging around the neck, the two bubbles formed one big, large, puffy collar. The wolf tried bringing their paws up to the collar to try to take it off, but the thing just wouldn’t budge, causing them to blush even brighter, breathe even heavier, and squirm even more. The arms quickly calmed them down by pressing the wolf’s hands on their torso and holding their knees tight.

After the wolf stopped jolting around, the hands continued their work. One gave the wolf a little pat before bubbling its head, muffling the world around it while tinting it even more rainbow than it already was. The wolf gave a muffled “meeep!-” in response, the only thing the wolf could do with their sealed maw. Another one went to the bubble’s edge right in front of the wolf and started sucking the bubble’s air back in, shrinking the bubble and making sure the captive couldn’t stand once it was done. The other two hands began making more rings around the wolf’s body, wrapping the knees together with a large bubble ring and pressing their arms against their chest using a similar ring.

Once their job was done, the hands left the bubble, gave it one last pat, and waved the blushy bubblebound wolf goodbye. The aura locking them in place scattered, releasing them to the bubble’s floor with nearly no way to do much of anything, let alone rebel against their new prison. A fan behind them started whirring, sending their small bubble through a large pipe in front of them.

Their bubble bounced off of the walls of the pipe countless times, the bubbles surrounding the wolf cushioning the blow so that their precious canine captive wouldn’t get hurt. After a bit, they could finally see some light. However, instead of being fluorescent, the light would come from the sun above. They pushed against the back of their bubble as much as possible, attempting to delay their bubbly fate.

Unfortunately, their pressing was not enough, plopping out of the pipe with no difficulty whatsoever. They gave themselves time to fully process what had just happened since they couldn’t do it in real time, not with all those arms poking and prodding at them. They looked down, the ground getting smaller and smaller as the bubble rose higher and higher. They looked at the building, seeing the one thing that doomed them to their floaty fate. The wolf looked up and blushed even more, their face completely red, knowing that they would be in that bright blue sky for a long time, if not forever~
