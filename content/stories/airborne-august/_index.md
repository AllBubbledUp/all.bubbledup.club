Airborne August is a month-long art challenge created by [2chaotic](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w7y2rvyof7h4z5slbvnh6nr7/) similar to Inktober, except the prompts are more oriented towards floaty stuff like balloons, bubbles, but mostly geared towards inflation (which, no, I won’t be doing), and it’s done in August instead.

I’ve decided to take part this year, mostly because I kinda just wanna write something bubbly again, but also because I think it may be fun.

So yeah, welcome to Airborne August. I hope you enjoy your stay, because it’s about to get a lot more bubbly from here~ ;3
