This is a tale about Aegis. He's a young adult with many different friends he hangs out with from time to time. However, none of those bonds could compare to the one he has with Ollie. Ollie has many of the same interests and hobbies Aegis has, and they do a lot of activities with each other.

At home, he kept one interest he had away from anyone else. He loved the concept of fictional bubbles. Bubbles of all shapes, sizes, and forms. He'd fantasize about them night after night, wishing to feel the soap against him,

Aegis and Ollie were riding a subway train when one asks about a bet they had placed yesterday. They bet on whether a stock would go up or down after a day. Aegis bet down, Ollie bet up. Both men were nervous as they checked the stock's prices. "It's up," Ollie said with excitement. Aegis gave a slight groan at the thought of what Ollie would make him do for losing a bet.

Ollie was searching around the train for inspiration on what Aegis' punishment should be. After seeing a soda can with small bubbles on the sides, he knew exactly what to say. "How would you feel about drinking a whole bottle of bubble solution," Ollie said with a smirk. Although Aegis liked bubbles, he most certainly did not like the taste of soap. Yet, he had no choice in the matter. A bet's a bet, and he already agreed to anything.

Once the pair were off the subway, they looked around for a store that would sell bubble solution, one very reluctantly. After a few minutes of looking, they spotted a party store to the left. They went in, found what they were looking for, paid for their purchase, and walked out.

Sitting at the curb, Aegis took the bottle and drank it in one fell swoop. He gave a few lemon faces when drinking it, but was done in less than a minute. Ollie was impressed with the speed and satisfied that his dare was complete. After such a daring move, the two decided it was time to part for the day and go home. They were starting to get tired themselves and agreed that it was time to go.

As he rode home, he let other things take his mind, like social media or how empty this train was. However, he still had the aftertaste of soap in his mouth. He somewhat worried about what could happen as a side effect and dropped down into his own bubbly fantasies. Around thirty minutes later, he reached his apartment, got himself ready for bed, and went to sleep.

***

He woke up to an especially bright sun. It wasn't too bright, but it was different enough to notice. Your eyes could've just been watery, or maybe the window blinds were open? Any way it was, he felt quite comfy in bed, and since it was an off day, he could spare the time to lay down a little longer.

Eventually, it comes time where he has to actually get out of bed and get ready for the day ahead. He sat up, still somewhat groggy, and started to get on his feet. However, his feet felt something strange. Instead of the wood flooring he was used to in his room, the floor was instead more glossy and smooth. He looked down and found that the ground was lighter than usual and seemed to change colors.

As he came to his senses, he noticed that the reason for the brighter sun, the lighter floor, and glossy texture was all around him. He was in a giant bubble! As soon as he found out, he was instantly happier. This was all of his dreams come true, he could finally feel what it was like to be in a bubble!

He went to his phone to tell Ollie the news. He tried reaching through the bubble to grab his phone, but he found that the bubble stretched with his hand. As he pushed harder, the bubble grew stronger and stronger before he couldn't exert anymore and the bubble rebounded into a spherical shape.

He bent down and grabbed the phone and tried to pull it in, but it slipped out before it would go through the surface. He tried a few more times, the phone slipping out of his membrane-wrapped hands each time. In the end, he settles for just resting it on the bed and tapping it from up close.

💬 **Aegis** 9:24 AM  
So uh, something happened

💬 **Ollie** 9:24 AM  
What

💬 **Aegis** 9:25 AM  
So, remember what you dared me to do yesterday

💬 **Ollie** 9:25 AM  
The drink a bubble bottle thing?

💬 **Aegis** 9:25 AM  
Yeah  
So I'm kinda in an actual bubble rn

💬 **Ollie** 9:26 AM  
Tf  
How?

💬 **Aegis** 9:27 AM  
I just kinda like  
Woke up to this  
Idk

While he was sleeping, his mouth opened and a bubble came out. It stayed for about a minute before detaching and floating to the roof. Once it hit the roof, it popped. As soon as the first one came, another one took its place. This time, it stayed for an hour, growing to be larger than him before he was eventually wrapped up inside.

💬 **Ollie** 9:28 AM  
Did you try popping it yet?

💬 **Aegis** 9:28 AM  
No, I haven't  
Let me go grab something

He went to his kitchen and grabbed the sharpest knife he could find. He made sure to get a careful grip on it -- you don't want it to drop, after all -- and slowly brought it towards the bubble's membrane. He was sad to know that the bubble would be gone so soon, that his fantasies would be left unanswered because of common sense asked by his friend.

However, when he brought the knife to the bubble's membrane, the bubble didn't pop. It only indented from something pushing against the side of the bubble, rebounding as soon as pressure was released. He was glad to be able to stay in this bubble, so he returned to his phone with the new knowledge.

💬 **Aegis** 9:31 AM  
I grabbed a knife  
Tried to pop the bubble  
But it didn't actually pop

💬 **Ollie** 9:32 AM  
Hmm  
That's odd  
Well, I'm sorry if the bubble causes any pain  
I didn't know it did that  
Just know that I'll enjoy your company  
Bubbled or not

This was heartwarming for Aegis, knowing that his best friend would never leave him over anything. It was a sign of their friendship, a sign of their enjoyment of one another. As if he wasn't happy enough because of the bubble surrounding him, he got the confirmation he needed to know that his best friend was as real as it gets.

💬 **Aegis** 9:34 AM  
Thank you ❤️  
Wanna meet up later?

💬 **Ollie** 9:34 AM  
Absolutely!

Now that the chat was over, Aegis could finally enjoy this bubble by himself. As he left his phone alone, he thought about how nice it would be if there was another bubble he could sit on like a chair. Just then, he hiccuped another bubble. As it came out, it grew to be the size of a typical bean bag chair.

As he sat down and enjoyed the spontaneous bubble, he wondered if it was just a coincidence or if he summoned that bubble by thinking about it. To test his theory, he thought about a beach ball-sized bubble that could sit in his lap. Right after, another bubble came out with the properties he had envisioned. He wanted to see if he could despawn it, so he thought of the new bubble popping. As soon as he envisioned it, the bubble was gone.

He wanted his new bubble bed to be larger, so he thought about it being bigger. Lo and behold, its size grew into a bed. He wanted to see if he could do the same with his containing bubble, so he imagined it was smaller. He was not ready for it to grow as small as to squish him between the bed and bubble. However, the pressure was just right to feel really nice, light a weighted blanket but all over.

He rested like this for many hours before realizing that he still had to meet up with his friend later.
