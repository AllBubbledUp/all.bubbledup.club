I occasionally make things within Minecraft. Skins, textures, builds; you name it, I've probably touched up on it at one point.

## Free Download: Bubblehead

Put this over your Minecraft skin's head to have a bubble on it. Don't worry about it ever coming off, it's already fused itself to your neck and it'll never pop no matter what you throw at it~ ;3c

## Resource Pack: Bubble Glass

![A picture of three shapes made of glass, the Bubble Glass resource pack applied.](./bubbleglass-preview.png)

Replaces regular glass (and glass panes) with bubble film instead. Supports CTM mods such as [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) and [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) for that nice, bubble film-like look :3
