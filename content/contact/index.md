{{<footnote>}}I usually keep my DMs on Bluesky open and my notifications on my phone enabled. If you DM me, I'll probably notice it.{{</footnote>}}
- **Email:** [bubbledupcat@gmail.com](mailto:bubbledupcat@gmail.com)  
{{<footnote>}}If you prefer going over email, here's my inbox. Please don't flood it! :3{{</footnote>}}

## Rules

- **Just ask the question!**  
{{<footnote>}}Basically, follow [no hello](https://nohello.net/en/) and [don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/) when in DMs with me. If you've got something to say, just say it.{{</footnote>}}
- **No conversation, no message.**  
{{<footnote>}}Please don't start messages with me expecting me to carry the conversation. If all you say is "hello" and "how are you", then don't message me.{{</footnote>}}
- **No random art.**  
{{<footnote>}}I get it, you're proud of what you made. However, all I ask is that you keep it out of my DMs. When I'm looking for art, I'll seek it out in other places, not in my inbox.{{</footnote>}}
- **Please, no {{<html>}}<abbr title="Not Safe For Public">NSFP</abbr>/<abbr title="Not Safe For Life">NSFL</abbr>{{</html>}} content.**  
{{<footnote>}}[Click here for more info.](https://rentry.co/nsfw-scale) Basically, no depictions of sex, light gore if any, thank you very much.{{</footnote>}}
- **Do not advertise, especially if we don't know each other.**  
{{<footnote>}}I don't appreciate random DMs with links to sites or Discord server invites. If you're someone I know, I'll just say "hey, please don't do that," however, if not, I will block you.{{</footnote>}}
