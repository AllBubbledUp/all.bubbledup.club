The sky was black out, the stars outshining the moon as the world fell dormant. Cyaine, a sharkpup, walks into a vacant pool after hours, carrying a big bag of bubbly things. A big vat of soap bubble solution, a few bubble wands ranging in size, a pocket bubble machine, and a deflated bubble ball were all ready to go. They would have a nice evening in a cool pool with nothing but the atmosphere of bubbles around.

They sat next to the pool in a lounge chair, bag to one side, solution to the other, and a filled bubble wand in their hand. As they blew bubbles out of the wand, they focused intently on the fresh spheres flying up into the sky. They gave a few thoughts to being trapped inside, feeling the weight of the world drop with the ground itself, floating away for a long, relaxing trip. It had been one of his biggest fantasies for the longest time, never having to worry about life’s worries as they’re whisked away.

However, they weren’t here just to sit around in front of a pool and daydream! They came to get in the water and enjoy the evening’s calm tides, so that’s what they’d do. They set down the wand, got the bubble machine out, set it next to the pool, and filled it with their soap solution. As they turned it on, bubbles immediately started to spill out rapidly, filling the surrounding air with their presence. With everything set up, they started their one-person party with a cannonball into the pool.

They immediately felt the cool water’s chill down their spine. It took some time to adjust, but, when they did, they started to play with the bubbles the machine produced. Nearly every single bubble popped almost as soon as they were formed by either Cyaine’s roughness or a stray water particle slamming into its side like a bullet. However, some floated into the sky, narrowly escaping the rough shark’s playful pops and triggering their floaty thoughts once again, slowly lulling them into yet another daydream.

The machine had run out of bubble already, automatically turning itself off and leaving Cyaine in the pool with their own fantasies. However, it would be a different noise that would yank them back to Earth. Strangely enough, the pool’s built-in lights shone brightly and the jets off to the side whirred to life, producing their own bubbles on the sides of the pool. No one else should’ve been there, it was too late an hour for any reasonable person to be around to control the pool, so it made the situation all the more confusing.

Another strange thing they noticed, the bubbles coming from the jets seemed to be growing, both in size and lifetime. What was first just some light foam frothing from the jets quickly became several bubbles the size of a thumb and still growing. These bubbles almost brought Cyaine’s mind back into the skies again, but their own anxieties kept them grounded. They had to get out of this pool and fast, who knows whatever security this pool seemed to have would do?

They rushed to the side of the pool with their bubble bag, tub and machine still outlying. They tried to pull themselves out of the pool, but, just before they’d escaped the waters’ grasp, they felt themselves pulled back as if something was preventing their foot paws from leaving the pool. Looking down, they saw what held them back. Several bubbles somehow stuck to and wrapped around their paws, bubbles that, for some reason, couldn’t go through the water’s surface. As more bubbles latched to every inch of their foot paws and legs, they started to merge.

First, a few bubbles fully encased their paws together, and they kept trying to tug themselves out. More bubbles started to merge around their legs, creeping their way up, and they kept trying and trying, failing more and more with each attempt. Their legs’ bubbles merge together, engulfing the rest of their legs together with more bubbles coming up and merging around their knee.

Instead of their failed tugging, they instead tried to move away from the jet this time. However, with their entrapped legs making it hard to go anywhere, their only hope was using their arms to push them out of the way. Rowing with their hands, they find that they made virtually no progress. With no other options, they stood there, doing their best to keep themselves afloat.

With even more bubbles around them, now crossing their torso as the rest of their knee’s bubbles merge together with the legs’ bubble, they discovered that the bubbles became more buoyant. Their lower body was able to keep them up due to this, somehow still standing upright. They sighed out of relief, they wouldn’t be drowning today due to a pool’s faulty system. However, that faulty system was still faulty, still spewing out bubbles, however much slower as they had grown to a hand’s size.

As their body was still covered by the pool’s bubbles, they pressed their hands against the now thick ring against their waist, blushing red from their helpless predicament, hoping that the bubbles would just peel right off. However, this would prove to be a bad idea as their hands passed through a bubble, sealing them both in makeshift cuffs.

It was at this time that the jets started to slow down even more, with smaller, less frequent bubbles coming out. It seemed these bubbles were less magnetized to them, some still grazing past and joining the crowd but otherwise just being normal pockets of air. Cyaine would also notice the sound of paws hitting the pool’s floor, a blue skunk walking towards the half-bubbled shark.

“Enjoying the calm pool, bubblebrain?” Volaire teasingly asked Cyaine.

“Uhm… aa…” They were struggling to make a sentence, already flustered as the skunk had found them in such an embarrassing position.

The skunk giggled in response, watching the blushing red shark stammer. “Good, good. Let’s make sure you get the best experience there~” They grabbed Cyaine’s wand, still primed with soap, and started blowing into it. A large bubble almost immediately came out, much larger than what Cyaine could ever make with it already. They pressed it against the helpless shark’s hip right above their bubblecuffs. Their face grew ever redder as the fresh bubble began to wrap around their body, eventually connecting and merging with itself to form a swim ring around the shark’s hip and arms.

“There, that should help you stay afloat,” Volaire teased the shark. “Now, let’s see, where were we… Oh, right, you need more bubbles, don’t you?”

Cyaine let out an audible “eep!” and turned their head away. Their whines were silenced, though, as they felt another bubble press against the tip of their maw. Its pressure grew until it suddenly released, forcing their maw inside and clamping it closed. Looking back, they saw Volaire laying stomach down on the concrete, kicking their legs while holding the wand out in front, blowing bubbles straight into Cyaine’s face with a smug look, seemingly foreshadowing what was to come later. One bubble even pressed against their face, encapsulating their head, ears, and bubbled muzzle in one large bubble helmet.

Getting up, Volaire spoke a few words to Cyaine. “Ready to go up, bubblebrain?” Cyaine immediately went red again, shaking their head. They tried to whimper and cry out, but the bubble around their maw still refused to let it open. “That’s what I thought, dork~”

With that, Volaire grabbed the heavily bubbled shark with their large, puffy tail and held them above the pool’s water. The jets kicked back on into overdrive, spewing large, squishy bubbles that moved toward the lifted shark. Some of the bubbles started to fly up against the shark, flooding them with bubbles sticking to them all over as they squirmed around. The rest stayed on the pool’s surface, collecting and merging into one large bubble. Once the bubble was about four feet in diameter, Volaire let the shark drop down onto it.

As soon as they touched the bubble, its membrane ***fwoomped*** around Cyaine, trapping them inside instantly. The bubble fell into the pool slightly from the recoil and then jumped back into the air. However, once their bubble bounced, it didn’t go back down again but instead kept floating up. The jets kept going, bubble after bubble flying into Cyaine’s prison and filling it with their soapy presence. As the bubble kept filling, Cyaine’s face kept growing redder and redder, blushing from the pressure of their new bubble friends. As the last bit of free space was filled, the jets turned off.

Volaire waved one last time to Cyaine. “Goodbye, bubblebrain, I hope you enjoy your new home in the sky~” Grabbing Cyaine’s bubble stuff, Volaire went back inside as the shark flew away, never to be seen on the ground again.
