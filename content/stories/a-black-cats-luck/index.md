Jamie, an anthro black cat with a passion for overgrown ruins, decided to go out into the woods in search for great photographs. They've always had an affinity for the dilapidated, as they've held the passion since 9. This is their first expedition out into their local woods.

Of course, many rumors surrounded the forest, many of fantasy and others of his interest. One such rumor was the reason for Jamie's journey, intriguing them with its supposed natural beauty growing over a large cluster of small buildings made of shipping containers. The prior use of the site was unknown, but what was for certain was the lost people count attributed to the place. Six people had gone out in search of the wonder, but none would ever return. Needless to say, Jamie was anxious about potentially growing an already large statistic.

About an hour later, Jamie was beginning to have thoughts about giving up. Up until that point, they hadn't found the mythical cluster, and they were ready to admit that it wasn't real. Fortunately for them, their luck would turn around. They couldn't believe what was in front of their eyes, they had found the base! Of course, they immedietely ran into the area, forgetting about the dangers inside. As soon as they entered, they pulled out their phone and got ready to take a lot of photos.

Looking around the place, Jamie began to hypothesize. What was this place? Who was here? How was this abandoned? They had many questions on their mind, and little ways to answer them. They kept looking around and entering random containers, finding a whole assortment of things prime for pictures. Of course, the containers themselves with many vines around them were great to look at, but taking pictures of walls and corners would get boring after a while. Looking inside one of the rooms, they found large metallic boxes that looked to be part of a manufacturing process. In another, they found printers capable of printing posters and flyers, most likely used for cheap advertising.

It was the last container that was the most interesting to Jamie. It was cut in half, with the top of it missing. In it, they found several stacks of small, clear balls. They wanted to pick one up to see more attributes, but little did they know that it would become their largest mistake. They tried to grab one, but in doing so they stuck their whole right hand into the pile. As soon as it happened, all of the balls in the stack stuck to their hand. They tried shaking to get rid of them, but to no avail.

As they tried to figure out what to do in this scenario, the balls started to inflate. Once Jamie noticed, they knew their fate. This must've been the method the previous people who visited this complex went missing, and now they would become one of them. As the balls inflated, they would also gradually merge into each other. After a few seconds, all of the balls were merged into one and Jamie's hand was fully ensnared up to their wrist. In reaction to it, Jamie tried to pry the wobbly bubble off of their hand. They realized their new mistake once they saw that their left hand stuck to the bubble, unable to move without the bubble following it.

Unfortunately for Jamie, the inflation continued after the merge, fully ensnaring their left hand crawling up their arms. As the bubble grew, the padding inside grew slimmer and slimmer. The bubble now contained Jamie's body and head, and acted more like a suit than a bubble. The bubble began forcing Jamie's top half into a curled position while growing down their legs. Farther and farther it reached until they were fully contained within the bubble.

The bubble Jamie was stuck in was small, stretchy, blue, and growing in iridescence. The bubble was made mainly of rubber, but contained other ingredients making the bubble completely immune to everything. Stuck inside such a small bubble, Jamie wanted to escape. They tried it all, from stretching the bubble to violent moves. Nothing worked, and the bubble squeaked and creaked with each movement, blocking out each and every sound from the outside world.

Growing tired of their failed escape attempts, Jamie realized that they weren't laying on the ground. Looking around for the first time since being ensnared, they realized that they were high above the complex. Seeing this made a feeling of anxiety grow in their body. They knew that this was it for their identity on the ground, and that they would be forever lost in the clouds. Although disheartening, they discovered that the bubble was shockingly comfortable. Although the outside was sticky and never granted any leeway, the inside was smooth and stretchy. Even better, the bubble was still inflating!

After dwelling on these ideas for long enough and looking at the images they took on their phone, they came to the conclusion that the unexpected flight into the sky was something they could be glad for. The bubble finished inflating to around four and a half feet, and the feline contained inside was left resting comfortably on the floor of the bubble.
