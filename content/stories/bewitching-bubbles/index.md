Pierre admired the deep cerulean blue ocean next to him, walking across the beach's cool sand with a starry night and a bright moon overlooking. It was one of his favorite pastimes, just going down to the beach just to walk around, sit, and enjoy the vacant sands.

However, tonight seemed... different. For some reason, Pierre felt a sort of unease walking down the beach. Tensions had been rising for him, tight deadlines and a long, terrible email chain from work taking up a bunch of his free time and his energy. It was Friday night, however, so he came down to the beach for some sort of escape, to finally rest.

He had been walking for a few minutes at this point, trying to find his favorite spot to sit, when he felt himself stopped by a wobbly surface. When he looked forward, he saw it, a large bubble slightly smaller than himself. He was somewhat intrigued by the bubble, considering that he was able to walk straight into it without it even popping. He wasn't doing much, so he figured he could mess with the bubble a bit.

He poked and prodded the bubble's surface, watching it bounce and undulate with his every touch. He even pushed his hands against it to test its strength, and it seemed to hold up very well. Not one to give up so easily, he pressed against the bubble even harder, and the bubble responded accordingly by denting inward.

Until the bubble had enough and swallowed his hands inside to *boomf* out to a near-spherical shape again. Pierre felt the pressure against his hands suddenly give way, leaning forward before catching himself. "That's enough," he said to himself, ready to move on. "It's time I get to that calming shade again..." He tried pulling his hands back out of the bubble, but failed, feeling the bubble stop him at his wrists. He took a quick good look at his hands and saw a bubble surrounding each, trapping his hands inside.

Pierre kept tugging at the soapy sphere trapping his hands. "Let go, ngh, you stupid, nmf, bubble!" However, the bubble had other plans. Bouncing around from Pierre's tugs, it pulled in both of his forearms, coating them in soap film with cuffs at the end to prevent him from pulling his arms out. He began to blush as he saw his soap-coated arms stuck, helpless against such a wobbly, innocent-looking bubble.

However, the bubble wasn't done just yet. Pierre felt himself forced ahead as the bubble started pulling on his arms by itself, reflecting his own image on the soap surface as it tugged against him as he did against the bubble just earlier. The bubble kept pulling and soap-coating, up the elbow, slurping on the rest of Pierre's arms until his face and torso started to touch the bubble.

Pierre whimpered out, hoping someone would hear his cries. However, he had fallen on deaf ears, no one else was around to enjoy a quiet beach. The bubble remained indifferent however, squishing around his upper half as the rest of his arms were pulled in. Even his shoulders made it in, both getting their own bubble to mirror the ones on his hands.

He tried once again to push his way through the bubble, this time pressing his hands against the inside of his soapy captor. Alas, it's hard to use a bubbled limb's full force and the bubble wouldn't have allowed it anyway. In that time, however, the bubble had gained some ground on Pierre. He heard a soft *pop!* as his head was forced inside the bubble, getting a bubble for itself, a bubble hat of some sort, and one around his maw, a bubble muzzle preventing him from whining... or really any sort of speaking. Eh, who needs speaking when you're bubbled anyways~

He was fully red now, blushy all over, and too flustered to get a word out-- not that he'd be able to open his mouth, anyway. The bubble started growing down Pierre's neck, forming a cute, puffy bubble collar around it and flustering him even more. The bubble made yet another bounce, pulling in all of his torso, putting his chest in a bubble and his hips in another bubble, this one more swim ring-like. The rest of his torso was covered in the same soapy film as his arms

The bubble started finalizing his entrapment, crawling down his legs and trapping his bushy tail in a slim bubble, giving his wagging tail an upward curve. He began to press against the side of his bubble prison in another escape attempt, blushing throughout, watching as the bubble wobbled, teasing him with its subtle indifference.

The bubble finally pulled in the rest of his legs, giving the waist-down a soap bubble skirt, both his feet their own bubble together, and the rest even more soap film. Now that he was fully trapped within his soapy captor's walls, it began to hover a few inches over the beach. Finally done with his entrapment, Pierre looked at himself through the bubble's reflection, seeing himself in a cute bubble witch-princess sort of outfit. He blushed, giggled at himself for a bit, and sat down.

The bubble, following the wind's current, floated down onto the water's surface a good few yards away from land, giving Pierre a great place to lay down, watch the tide's ebb and flow, and look up at the stars. As he stared at the great, black sky, let his worries leave his mind, and let his heavy eyelids fall, he drifted asleep.

Early the next morning, Pierre woke up to a still-vacant beach, his bubble prison had long left him ashore, yet left him in his bewitched outfit. He walked back home, ready for a great weekend ahead of him.
