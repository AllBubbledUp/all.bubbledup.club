A certain bubbled fox hosted a whiteboard canvas for many of us to draw on. Below, you can see some of my own contributions along with some using my own characters.

![A drawing of me trapped in a bubble, pressing against both my prison's floor and ceiling :3 I eventually turned this into its own pixel art sticker, I think I look cute in both ^^](./bubble-pressing.png)
![Just a random bubble I drew to test Magma since we swapped over to it instead of WhiteboardFox. Eventually, Crirex came along and stuffed me inside the bubble of my own creation.](./random-bub.png)
![Just three bubblebrains trapped together, some more bubbled than others :3c. Originally, Crirex only had the bubble below them, but I added the rest to, you guessed it, tease them in DMs.](./trio.png)
![I'm bored and want to draw something, so I message Crirex and ask them what I should draw. They responded wombubble, so I did. I don't think they were expecting themselves to be the one trapped inside, though~](./wombubbled-cri.png)
![After trapping Crirex in a tight wombubble, I asked them who I should bubble next. They gave me Evy, and I gave them a bubble to get trapped in. That's revenge for teasing and taunting me while I was trapped in a bubble >:3](./bubbled-evy.png)
